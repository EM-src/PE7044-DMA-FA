# PE7044 Final Assignment details

Part 1
(A) Using a database design approach of your choice, produce a logical design for the database to support the information
    system, which is needed at PropertyPortal.

    A set of normalised relations (10 marks) obtained through applying the normalisation process (10 marks) instead of ER
    modelling. You should make clear how the normalisation process has been carried out, and the reasoning employed, in
    particular quoting evidence (series of steps) to support the decisions made and how various relations have been derived.
    Each final relation in your answer should be in 3rd normal form.

(B) Based on your logical design from Part 1 (A) and the information available in the scenario, produce an SQL script file
    using Oracle 11g/12c/19c.

Part 2
(A) Populate the PropertyPortal database with some data (e.g., you should generate your own dummy data and load it into the
    PropertyPortal database, consider 5 to 8 rows for each table and enough data to see meaningful output for the queries
    below).

(B) Answer the following queries (retrievals) using SQL and/or PL/SQL and relational algebra.

(Q1)Display details of detached or semi-detached properties for sale having at least four bedrooms in the Fenham or Heaton
    areas of Newcastle that were added to the system in the last 42 days.

(Q2)Display details of properties sold in Newcastle, Sunderland, Gateshead or Cramlington between £195,000 and £375,000 in
    the years 2018 to 2022.
